# Classification-Stars

# Introdiction
A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but due to their immense distance from Earth they appear as fixed points of light in the sky. The most prominent stars are grouped into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars, but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth.

# Problem statement
We want to determine the types of stars according to our data and to know whether the star is a giant or a dwarf for the purpose of studying the stars and galaxies surrounding us.

# Value to the company
We will make a model to identify the types of stars, this model will help the Saudi Space Comission in its study to know the stars and help him to achieve the comission's vision to delve into space sciences.
